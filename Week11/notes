## Week 11 | Serverless Backends
-- What are backends Servers?
You might have used express to create a Backend server.
The way to run it usually is "node index.js" which starts a process on a certain port (3000 for example)

When you have to deploy it on the internet, there are a few ways-
1. Go to AWS, GCP, Azure, Cloudfare
a. rent a Virtual machine and deloy your app,
b. put it in an auto scaling group
c. deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster,

There are a few downsides to during this -
1. taking care of how/when to scale
2. base cost even if no one is visting your website
3. monitoring various servers to make sure no server is down.
