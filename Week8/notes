## Axios vs Fetch
-- fetch() method
The fetch method in JS is a modern API that allows yo to make network request, typically to retrieve data from a server.

## what is the fetch() method?
the fetch method is a built-in JS fynction that simplifies making HTTPs requests. It return Promise that resolves to the Response to that request, whether it is successful or not.

## Why is it Used?
1. Asynchronous Data Retrieved:
The primary use of the fetch() method is to asynchronously retrieve data from a server. Asynchronous menas that the code doesnt wait for the data to arrive before moving on. This is crucial for creating responsive and dynamic web applications.

2. Web API interaction:
Many web applications interact with external services or API to fetch data. The fetch() method simplifies the process of making HTTP requests to these APIs.

3. Promise-based:
The fetch() method returns a Promise, making it easy to work with asynchronous operations using .thrn() and .catch() methods. This promotes cleaner and more readable code.

4. flexibable and powerful
fetch() is more flexible and powerful compared to older methods like XMLHTTPRequest. It supports a wide range of options, including headers, request methods, and handling different types of responses(JSON,text,etc).
